# Remote internships @ Big Data Biology Lab

---

# Time commitment

- Contribute at least _20 hours per week_ during the internship period. This
  does not mean that **every single week** you need to contribute 20 hours, but
  _on average_.
- Be able to participate for 6-12 weeks (depending on how much time per week
  you can commit).
- We can be flexible, but too short times are not feasible.

---

# Physical conditions

- Have regular access to a decent internet connection (it should be good enough
  that you can have regular voice Zoom/Skype calls).
- A computer, but a standard ageing laptop is fine.

---

# You get

- Weekly meetings with the PI (Luis Pedro Coelho) for discussing the project
  and mentoring.
- Meetings with other [lab members](https://big-data-biology.org/people) and
  participation in the group meetings/discussions.
- A small stipendium (450 USD) upon successful completion.

- We **do not** provide any academic credit, but you may be able to arrange
  that with your university (your responsibility).

---

# What does "successful completion" mean?

- Deliverables: code/data and a blogpost/presentation.

---

# Who can apply?

Anyone can apply, but this programme is primarily aimed at:

- Junior students (undergraduate +/- 2 years).
- Students in [LMICs](https://wellcome.ac.uk/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries).
- With some bioinformatics/computational biology training (alternatively,
  computer science students who want to work on bioinformatics).

Students with no research experience are welcome!

**Current deadline**: _September 30 2020_ any timezone

# Projects

- Will be discussed with you at the start of the project.
- Should be at the limit of your abilities so that it is both _feasible_ and
  _stretches your skills_ (_i.e._, you learn something).

---

# Possible Projects

## Computational Biology

- Analysing the co-occurrence networks of ARGs

## Methods

- Can we find cryptic AMPs in proteins?
- Algorithms for small memory quantification in metagenomes

## Tools

- Add more downstream analysis to
  [GMGC-mapper](https://gmgc-mapper.readthedocs.io). Based on Jupyter and the
  Python Data Science Ecosystem.
- Add SNP analysis to [NGLess](https://ngless.embl.de/)
- Improve [NGLessPy](https://ngless.embl.de/nglesspy.html)

## Community/documentation

- Create videos/tutorials/run an online class...
