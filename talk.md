# Remote internships @ Big Data Biology Lab


WE WILL START AT THREE MINUTES PAST NOON

I assume you can hear me

---

# BDB-Lab

- [https://www.big-data-biology.org/](https://www.big-data-biology.org/)

---

# Time commitment

- Contribute at least _20 hours per week_ during the internship period. This
  does not mean that **every single week** you need to contribute 20 hours, but
  _on average_.
- Be able to participate for 6-12 weeks (depending on how much time per week
  you can commit).
- We can be flexible, but too short times are not feasible.

---

# Physical conditions

- Have regular access to a decent internet connection (it should be good enough
  that you can have regular voice Zoom/Skype calls).
- A computer, but a standard ageing laptop is fine.

---

# You get

- Weekly meetings with supervisor (either Luis or someone else) for discussing
  the project and mentoring.
- Meetings with the PI (Luis Pedro Coelho)
- Meetings with other [lab members](https://big-data-biology.org/people) and
  participation in the group meetings/discussions.
- A small stipendium (450 USD) upon successful completion.

- We **do not** provide any academic credit, but you may be able to arrange
  that with your university (your responsibility).

---

# What does "successful completion" mean?

- Art/science-focused project: A piece in whatever medium
- Outreach-focused project: A presentation, a tutorial, an online course,...
- Deliverables: code/data and a blogpost/presentation

Again, this will be individually defined

---

# Who can apply?

Anyone can apply, but this programme is primarily aimed at:

- Junior students (undergraduate +/- 2 years).
- Students in [LMICs](https://wellcome.ac.uk/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries).
- With some bioinformatics/computational biology training (alternatively,
  computer science students who want to work on bioinformatics).

Students with no research experience are welcome!

**Current deadline**: _Feb 28 2022_ any timezone

# Projects

- Will be discussed with you at the start of the project.
- Should be at the limit of your abilities so that it is both _feasible_ and
  _stretches your skills_ (_i.e._, you learn something).

---

# Possible Projects (I)

### Community/documentation

- Create videos/tutorials/run an online class...
- Create an _art piece_ around our work...

### Computational Biology

- Synteny between small proteins and antimicrobial resistance genes

_This list is not exhaustive: we will decide individually..._

---

# Possible Projects (II)

### Methods

- Algorithms for small memory quantification in metagenomes

### Tools

- Improve [SemiBin](http://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin)
- Improve [NGLessPy](https://ngless.embl.de/nglesspy.html)

_This list is not exhaustive: we will decide individually..._
